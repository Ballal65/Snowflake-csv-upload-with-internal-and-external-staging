# Purpose of this Repository
This repository is a tutorial and code reference for loading data into Snowflake using internal and external stages. It provides step-by-step guidance and examples to help you efficiently upload data to Snowflake's internal/external staging  for further processing and analysis. In this example, we are using a simple pokedex CSV file. 

## What is Staging? 
Snowflake staging refers to temporarily storing data in a staging area within Snowflake before loading it into a table or after unloading it from a table. If data is stored inside Snowflake, we call it 'Internal Staging.' If data is stored in AWS, Azure, or GSP, we call it 'External Staging.'
