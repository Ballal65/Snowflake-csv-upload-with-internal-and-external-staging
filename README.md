# Purpose of this Repository
This repository is a tutorial and code reference for loading data into Snowflake using internal stages. It provides step-by-step guidance and examples to help you efficiently upload data to Snowflake's internal and external staging  for further processing and analysis.

## What is Staging? 
Snowflake staging refers to temporarily storing data in a staging area within Snowflake before loading it into a table or after unloading it from a table. If we store data inside the Snowflake, we simply call it 'Internal Staging' If data is stored in AWS, Azure or GSP, we call it 'External Stagign'
